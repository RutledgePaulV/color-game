Would you like to play a game?

There once was a tree that stood taller than all the rest. It's trunk had two limbs, each limb had three branches,
and each branch had five twigs, and each twig had seven leaves and each leaf had eleven points.

One morning the dew had left behind a small creature on each leaf. These critters are particularly fond of eleven pointed
leaves and so they began to eat. The creatures always eat the leaf they're on starting by biting a point close to the twig 
and working their way around. All of the creatures on the seventh twig of every branch eat counterclockwise, and the 
others on the branch eat clockwise.

As the hungry critters ate their leaves they began to change colors! It turns out that each leaf has seven points that
each contain a drop of dye, one for each color of the rainbow. The other four points have a dusting of super absorbent powder
that causes them to expel one drop of dye from their store (which is always an average between the colors they've consumed).

Once the critters have consumed all the points on their leaf, they crawl down the trunk of the tree and jump into a bucket of white
dye whose volume is the same as the amount of dye that could be collected if each critter completely filled their store (seven drops). 
Once they're all inside the bucket, they swim around until the dye is distributed throughout the bucket and then they march back up the 
trunk of the tree in order to wipe off the dye they were swimming in. 

If I want the trunk to be as close as possible to my favorite color (#FFFFF), 
which points of each leaf do I want to have been dusted with absorbent powder?

Every leaf will have the colors of the rainbow distributed across seven points in a clockwise fashion, and the points
that you designate for dusting with powder will just be skipped.


The colors of the rainbow are:

R - #FF0000
O - #FF7700
Y - #FFDD00
G - #00FF00
B - #0000FF
I - #8A2BE2
V - #C77DF3


Assume that colors of various volumes are averaged by taking a weighted average of their components (RGB)
