Would you like to play a game?

There once was a tree that stood taller than all the rest. It's trunk had three limbs, each limb had four branches,
and each branch had five twigs, and each twig had six leaves and each leaf had seven points. This tree was very special
in that every night it regrows whatever leaves had been eaten the day before so that it always has plenty for all the 
creatures that munch.

In the mornings the dew would leave behind one small creature on each leaf of the tree. These creatures only need a little
food and so each day they eat only the leaf the dew left them on. The creatures always eat the leaf they're on starting by 
biting a point close to the twig and working their way around the leaf. All of the creatures on the fifth twig of every branch 
eat counterclockwise, and the others on the branch eat clockwise.

As the hungry critters eat their leaves they begin to change colors! It turns out that each leaf has seven points that
each contain a drop of dye (one drop for each color of the rainbow). Having witnessed this one day, the next I decided to sprinkle
some special powder in 4 places between certain points on each leaf that causes the critter to expel one drop of dye from 
their belly (which is always an average between the colors they've consumed) when they eat it (so long as they have at least one drop).

Once the critters have consumed all of the points on their leaf, they crawl down the trunk of the tree and jump into a bucket of pure white
dye whose volume is the same as the amount of dye that could be collected if each critter completely filled their belly (which can hold up to seven drops). 
Once they're all inside the bucket, they swim around until the dye is distributed throughout the bucket and then they march back up the 
trunk of the tree in order to wipe off the dye they were swimming in, resulting in a beautifully colored tree trunk.


The colors of the rainbow are:

- R = #FF0000
- O = #FF7700
- Y = #FFDD00
- G = #00FF00
- B = #0000FF
- I = #8A2BE2
- V = #C77DF3

Notes:

- Every leaf will have the colors of the rainbow distributed across seven points in a clockwise fashion 
(starting with red and following ROY G BIV), and the powder can only exist between points. However, there 
can be multiple patches of powder (out of the four total) between two points, and each patch consumes one drop.
- Assume that dyes of various volumes are averaged by taking a weighted average of their RGB components.
- Don't round anything until the end, and then you should round to integer RGB components
- Assume all leaves will have the same color / patch order.

If I want the trunk to be as close as possible to my favorite color #DDC7EC, 
which patches of each leaf do I want to have been dusted with absorbent powder?


List out the points in clockwise order indicating where each color is and where each powder patch is.
(e.x: [red, POWDER, POWDER, orange, yellow, green, POWDER, blue, POWDER, indigo, violet])
